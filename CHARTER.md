# RISC-V E-Trace Encapsulation TG Charter 

The E-Trace Encapsulation TG will define how trace packet payloads shall be encapsulated.

In line with the original charter, the ratified Enhanced Trace for RISC-V standard defines packet payloads for instruction and data trace but does not fully define how this should be encapsulated. Chapter 7 gives some illustrative examples but this is insufficiently detailed and informative only.

The E-Trace Encapsulation TG will deliver a normative trace encapsulation specification that:

 - Applies to Enhanced Trace for RISC-V packets but which is not restricted to that standard

To achieve its goals, the E-Trace Encapsulation TG, will interact with the following groups: SoC HC, DTPM SIG.
